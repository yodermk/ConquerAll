# ConquerAll

An attempt at a relatively generic version of a "conquer the world"
type game that emphasizes the development of artificial intelligence
players that can play on any map with an arbitrary combination of rules.

Rules can include what happens when turning in sets -- do you get a
constant aount of new armies depending on the set type, or an escalating
value?  Or maybe it will just nuke the territories instead?

For reinforcements, rules can allow moving only to an adjacent country
or through your territories to a distant land.

More to come.

## Status

It compiles.  Not expected to be playable or even really runnable.
Needs lots of testing.

Most of the main logic is there for game flow but need to finish it out.

Then the real fun - the AI players.
